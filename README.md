# bukain

A fundraising platform using Bukalapak API and firebase as a temporary no sql.

###Main Idea
The android App - Bukain, as of now is an aplication for user only. 
A User can search for project ideas that they might find interesting, innovative and/or creative. 
A project may consist of multiple products of the same idea. 
Each product is a Bukalapak product with a few distinction that it is being bought pre-ordered.

A project have minimum modal needed and a deadline. 
Whence the modal and the deadline have been met, the production will then begin and the products must be delivered to the customers between the estimation.
Everything on the system is the same as in Bukalapak, except that the products are being pre-ordered and the production itself is funded by the customers.

####API
It can be said that this system is an extension of the current C2C in Bukalapak. 
Every API in Bukalapak can be used with an addition of projects database.
As of now we are using Firebase to store the projects data.
